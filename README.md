# VR_Generative_Music

This VR Scene was created in Unity/C#.

It spawns a randomized number of orbs at randomized positions around the user. Each orb has an audio source attached to it, playing a randomized sound loop from an array. The result is a generative musical track which is a bit different every time you launch the scene.

All sounds for the scene were created by me. The skybox is a free asset from Unity Asset Store.
